In an electric circuit, the current of i(t) passes from the resistance of r(t) = 0.01*i  + 2*i^(2/3) which is dependent on the current. Calculate the resistance voltage in the interval of [0, 60] using Simpson’s 1/3 Rule. (The current formula is as follows)


i(t) = (60-t)^2 + (60-t)*sin((t-2)^(0.5))
